# my_manual

A Clojure project, which contains only my source code.

## Usage

This is just used as a manual or reference, cause I'm a beginner in the Clojure.

## Reference

Many codes are from "Living Clojure: An Introduction and Training Plan for Developers" (author: Carin Meier)
and Clojure problems in http://www.4clojure.com.
